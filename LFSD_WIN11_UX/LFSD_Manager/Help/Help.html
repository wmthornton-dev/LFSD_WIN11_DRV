<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to provide a stable, reliable, and performant driver for Windows 11+ that allows users to access their Linux file systems from Windows without using WSL/WSL2.
This driver is based upon the Ext2Fsd project, but is not a clone of it. The Ext2Fsd project is a great project, but it has not been updated in a long time and is missing many features that users have come to expect from a file system driver. This project aims to fill that gap by providing a modern, feature-rich driver that is actively maintained and supported.
This project is still in the early stages of development, so there are likely to be bugs and missing features. However, we are actively working on improving the driver and adding new features, so stay tuned for updates!</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>This project is being developed in C++ using the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). We are using the latest version of the WDK to ensure that the driver is compatible with the latest versions of Windows.
If you are interested in contributing to the project, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. We are always looking for new contributors to help us improve the driver and add new features.
You will need the Visual Studio 2022 IDE to build the driver. You can download Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition for free from the Microsoft website, or use the Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools if you prefer a smaller installation.
We can provide a license key for Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise Edition if you need it. Please contact us for more information.</p>
